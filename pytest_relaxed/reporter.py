# TODO:
# - how can we be sure the tests are in the right order?
#   - aka how can we 'sort' them? in post-collection step?
# - how to handle display of 'header' lines? Probably state tracking as w/
# spec?
# - how to deal with flat modules vs nested classes?
# - would be nice to examine all tests in a tree, but that requires waiting
# till all results are in, which is no bueno. So we really do just need to
# ensure a tree-based sort (which, assuming solid test ID strings, can be a
# lexical sort.)
#   - sadly, what this means is that the parent/child relationship between test
#   objects doesn't really help us any, since we have to take action on a
#   per-report basis. Meh. (guess if we NEEDED to access attributes of a parent
#   in a child, that'd be possible, but...seems unlikely-ish? Maybe indent
#   based on parent relationships instead of across-the-run state tracking?)
